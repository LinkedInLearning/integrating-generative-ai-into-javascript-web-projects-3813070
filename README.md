<p>The emergence of AI has been the center of attraction on the web since the release of the first GPT language models by OpenAI in November 2022. As a result, there’s been a growing interest within the tech community to explore the potential of generative AI technologies in web development.</p><p>In this course, join instructor Sandy Ludosky as she provides an introduction to generative AI and its many possible applications using the JavaScript language and its frameworks. Explore the core concepts of generative AI with practical, hands-on examples. Sandy shows you how to build an AI-powered chatbot with Node.js and then extend the chatbot’s capabilities by allowing it to call external APIs with function calling. By the end of this course, you’ll also be ready to build an AI-powered virtual assistant with the OpenAI Assistants API.</p>

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
